The Problem which our app solves
An android and ios based application to be built for image analysis and image processing of Otoscope
images. The application should be able to set the proper orientation of the clicked image, Remove
Blue Light from background and add text at the corners of image.
The android application should have option to click image or upload the image to be processed. Once the
user clicks or uploads the image then, proceed as follows
• Check Clarity of Image
• Check if any wax is present in the ear canal if yes, prompt about percentage of was present.
• Remove blue light from image (By adding Blue-Light Filter)
• Check the image is Right Ear Otoscope Image or Left Ear Otoscope Image
• After deciding about the side, then compare the image with database of sample images and
check the orientation of the image
• If required, change and set it to proper orientation
• Add Patient Name to the upper corner and Side of Ear(R or L) to the lower corner of image as
text
• Save the image in proper location in phone memory.
